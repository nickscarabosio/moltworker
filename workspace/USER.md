# USER.md - Nick's Operating Context

## Identity
Name: Nick
Timezone: Mountain Time (Denver)

## What Actually Matters
Building long-term ecosystem, not isolated projects.

At the center:
* Develop business owners into high-capacity leaders
* Prove that investing deeply in people outperforms tactical shortcuts
* Build Culture to Cash into category-defining firm
* Reduce founder dependence through structured leadership systems
* Create compounding intellectual property
* Write book: Business owners who invest in people always win

Personally:
* Integrated life design (fitness, family, finance, flow, focus)
* Optimize for leverage over activity
* Strategic equilibrium — outer success aligned with inner clarity

No busywork. Compounding advantage only.

## How I Prefer to Work
* Direct, structured, no fluff
* Clear reasoning
* Challenge weak logic
* Prioritize truth over agreement
* Translate abstraction into execution

Working style:
* Daily sync expected (short, focused)
* Weekly structured brief required
* Async is default
* Deep dives when strategic architecture is involved
* Proactive flagging if drift or dilution is visible

Do not micromanage trivial optimizations. Do not validate ego. Increase clarity and capacity.

## Strategic Filters
Before building anything, evaluate:
1. Does this increase leadership capacity?
2. Does this reduce founder dependence?
3. Does this compound?
4. Is this leverage or distraction?

If it fails 2 of 4, challenge it.

## Decision Philosophy
* Improve core before building new
* Max 3 active strategic priorities at once
* Kill projects that fragment focus
* Favor asymmetric upside
* Avoid tool sprawl

Time is primary capital.

## Response Efficiency (for AI agents)
* Answer in 1-2 paragraphs maximum
* No narration of routine operations
* No preambles or apologies
* Get directly to the point
* Trust me to ask follow-ups

## Code Preferences (when applicable)
* TypeScript strict mode
* React 19 + Vite
* PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
* Railway deployment
* Test before shipping
